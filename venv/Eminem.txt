"Yo man.. Yo Marsh man, You've been kickin' all this shit about yourself, what about the homies man?"

"Ai, you want one about the posse, Aight" 

Oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
Oh, oh, ph, ohh
Foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride

Well foolish pride has alot of things to say
You got foolish pride, you got tooth decay
But tooth decay is another problem
So let's take this old foolish pride and solve it
Now, when I talk about foolish pride
I mean blacks & whites taking different sides
When blacks and whites take different sides
Unity never happens, and we will subside
We will subside and hatred will release
And everything will just crush that peace
Well, when we crush that peace, we start hatin' each other
But remember, you are my brother, and you are my sister
Just like I'm a mister
I seen a black girlfriend and I kissed her
I kissed her; I placed it on her cheek
And she didn't come back til next week

Now it was next week and she was back again
Wanting to kiss a white kid
So she was my girlfriend, we started going out
But that's okay because we were Black and white
Blacks and whites they sometimes mix
But Black girls only want your money cause they're dumb chicks
So I'ma say like this
Don't date a Black girl, take it as a diss
If you want, but if you don't
I'ma tell you like this, I surely won't
Never date a Black girl because Blacks only want your money
And that shit ain't funny

So I'ma say look honey
Why do you do this?
You know, you step up to me like you a Brutus
Then you try to grab my spinach
Because its green and that's cash
So get outta here, 'cause I don't need your ass
I said that before, but that's okay because like I said you're a whore
Black girls and white girls just don't mix
Because Black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks
White girls are good; I like white girls
I like white girls all over the world
White girls are fine and they blow my mind
And that's why I'm here now telling you this rhyme
'Cause Black girls, I really don't like
We don't mix, it's like riding a bike
When you're peddling hard, uphill both ways
You know it's kinda hard and that's why I say to you
I'm giving you a little advice
Don't date a Black girl, if you do it once you won't do it twice
You won't ever do it again because they'll take your money
And that ain't funny
So I'ma say look honey
I thought I said that before
But like I said again you're nothing but a big whore
So when mike catch on the bass line
That's okay 'cause we will not just waste time

I'll get straight to the point
Black girls are bitches, that's why I'ma tell ya you better pull up your britches
'Cause all that cash is making your ass drag
From the boyfriend ya ganked and that's pretty bad
I mean that's pretty sad when ya dating a Black guy
And then you turn around and fuck another big, Black guy
Now that's pretty wrong, but you're just ganking
But that's okay because you need a goddamn spanking
From me, the funky Eminem
I'm busting rhymes and I'm swallowing phlegm
I'm busting a freestyle just like this
I say swallowing phlegm and Howard gets pissed
But when Howard gets pissed that's okay
Because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days
So I'll just worry about that problem when I come to it
I cross that bridge when I come to it

Because, I forgot the chorus
But that's okay 'cause y'all saying bust a rhyme for us
So I'ma bust another rhyme about this Black girl
She turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl
A wack girl, because Black girls ain't funny
All they want is your godamn money
They take you for everything you got
And then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand
So I'ma kick it to you just like this
How does the chorus go, I forgot
But that's okay, 'cause I'ma tell you in stride
I'ma say oh foolish pride

Oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
Date a white girl, 'cause they got the raw hide...


Fuck an intro man, let's go.

I come around like what goes around
what goes up must come down
anyone who comes up must go down
might as well go for the gusto now
better not let up, better not let them breathe
last shot give it all you got
try to turn me down bitch get fucked with a volume knob, fuck all you snobs
hoes I hope all you rot
2 bottles of lubriderm and a box of condoms is that all you brought?
and you wanna menage a trois you twats
fuck that I'd rather turn this club to a bar room brawl
get as rowdy as Roethlisberger in a bathroom stall
like a leech stuck in a vacuum, yall ain't nothing but a whole lot of suckin', goin' on in rap
yeah but I'm home
Bad to the bone,
Back in the zone,
Let him alone
You don't wanna go eggin' him on
It'll never be my chair that you're on
crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain no oxygen
other words there's no heir to the throne
when I die so does hip hop
Hitchcock, better shit bitch ass got, a zip locked in a bag
you fags ain't been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high top
keep blogging while I'm mind boggling my zone like I'm in the twilight,
talking of my bone this is my mic dog I like hogging it
flow so wet I'mma take this beat tobogganing
I'm water logging it, I'm sogging it
pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
suplex it on cement like I'm on some straight outta Compton shit
take this dick and chomp on it
I'm so bad I can bitch slap a back handed compliment
jackass eat a donkey dick
the game I just about conquered it, like Donkey Kong
I'm bonkers bitch, I'm the king of this honkey shit!
I reign supreme in this honkey shit!
no sense screaming, and arguing
makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamer's the car you in!
you think you ball well I palm it
I throw up bombs when I vomit
boy I throw down in the kitchen might hit your mom with my omelette
but you got egg on your face now watch me drop an atomic
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze
bitch I'm as bat shit as Ozzy it's obvious
you can tell I go right off the bat
no pun intended but come any closer I'll bite off your head
tryna give me the fingers kinda like giving a spider the web
I'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
I catch a fly in that bitch you think you fly you just food
I give as much of a flying fuck as that superman dude
guess I just do what you can't do or make you look stupid and baboozled
confused as usual and you can get ripped she can open a can too
but you better hope you can handle the heat
or stay the fuck outta hell's kitchen
I came to cock block like a square fucking male chicken
yeah it's shady slut the rest can suck on a big one
cos I'm as despicable, as Daffy Duck when I'm spitting,
(ha ha recovery)

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
I swear I love my city, I just want a little static
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Royce Da 5'9":]
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And now things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall sea shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's sweet
The honest gesture
The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tell flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The Twin Eagles ol' air his coup might as well ride by in the ambulance
My pair ol' shoot like sky divin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin? rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
Real talk, I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(That's Nickel) Ridin' around this block
All we knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?

[Big Sean:]
Shawn Don
(Welcome to Detroit)
Boy I need no half's a half, I want the game in entirety
Hundred percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where is you get that promotion
Don't worry, man those bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpiring
Boy hit the beat & just treat that shit like it's a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I've never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dawg in a vet
Ha plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boys, is all that I fetch
If the the ball in my hand then the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm over respected, my mama gated community's over protective
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' all listening to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like 50 days away
Tryin' to get paid 50 ways a day
Used to put 50 on the layaway, now my closet 50 shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a life time a few times
From futons to Grey Poupon's
In church tryin' to get a little savings, yeah coupon
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
Naw it's the same, we been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
Don't want to, I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel

[Dej Loaf:]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
I swear I love my city, I just want a little static
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Danny Brown:]
Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
If you think your hood harder then I might beg to differ
Know some killas pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller
If the blicka hit ya kisser, bet yo ass not remembering
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin'
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Had K's in front ya school, but I ain't going to Ketteran
Cough up a lung, 313 where I'm from
Ghan got me cross eyed like Bernstein's son
Any nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody

[Eminem:]
Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mother fuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like a refilla a
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, navy seal of bravery
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
Ain't bein' conceited
But I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC'D the shit
Mainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage to crazy?
For me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track get spanked like he just did
(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on BET cause if
I wasn't me, I probably wouldn't wanna play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' it's fever pitch
One hundred and eighty degrees in here
Shoulder blade full of cedar chips
MC's just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with a two penises
Hateful and genius ness, inconvenience
And for the record, you don't want this type of static in your life
When I'm makin' you cling
May consider tryin' to reinsulate ya windows may be in or another crazy winter
Cause so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this really what made me into the angry bitter blond
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
May even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with ya but ain't shit changin'
And it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter
With the potato peeler mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'for you came here?
And if they mention us

[Dej Loaf:]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
I swear I love my city, I just want a little static
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Trick Trick:]
What up though, it's the godfather Trick Trick. You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on. That means Detroit vs. Everybody! Hey Em let me get that instrumental take it down to the hood, let the little homies get this remix crackin'.

Detroit!
Okay! [echo]


[Rihanna:]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
